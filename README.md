# ffa_free_cities

A group rewrite of [Free Cities](https://www.tfgamessite.com/?module=viewgame&id=751)

## Where to start

Just want to add some flavor text?  Add some short descriptions for [asses](description/description_ass.tw2), [breasts](description/description_breasts.tw2), [dicks](description/description_cock.tw2), or [vulvas](description/description_vagina.tw2).  You can also [add names and general physical descriptions](description/description_physical.tw2).

Want to write sex scenes? Checkout the [f/f](/ff/), [f/m](/fm/), [m/f](mf), or [m/m](mm) folders or the inspect actions ([female](/inspect/finger_pussy_reaction.tw2) and [gender neutral](/inspect/finger_ass_reaction.tw2)).  The first letter is the player character gender, the second character is the slave character gender (ie, ff is for female player/female slave, fm is for female player/male slave) and scenes should be written in second person.

Worried about messing things up?  Don't be!  There's comments at the start of every file about how to make changes, and everything is undoable.

If you know Sugarcube and want to add passages, checkout [the list of existing passages](passage-titles.txt).
